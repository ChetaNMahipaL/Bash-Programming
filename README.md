## Bash Scripting Proficiency

In this assignment, I demonstrated proficiency in Bash scripting and the ability to perform various tasks related to system administration, file manipulation, and data processing. Here are some of the key tasks I accomplished:

### Question 1 - Age Calculator

I implemented a Bash script `q1.sh` to calculate a person's age in months. The script prompts the user for their name and birth date, and then calculates and displays the age in months.

### Question 2 - Personal Contact Book Management

I created a versatile contact book management script `q2.sh`. This script allows users to perform various operations on a personal contact book stored in a CSV file, including inserting, editing, displaying, searching, and deleting contacts. It utilizes command-line flags to specify the desired operation and options for each operation.

### Question 3 - Word Filtering

I wrote a series of scripts (e.g., `q3_1.sh`, `q3_2.sh`, etc.) to filter words in a file (`words.txt`) based on specific criteria. These scripts identify words that start with specific letters, contain substrings, are palindromes, and more.

### Question 4 - File Manipulation

I implemented scripts (e.g., `q4_1.sh`, `q4_2.sh`, etc.) to manipulate text files. These scripts remove words containing certain characters, filter words based on their length, convert words to lowercase, and group words by the number of vowels they contain.

### Question 5 - Tree Command

I created a tree-like directory structure printing script `q5.sh`. It can display the contents of a folder, including options to show hidden files, limit the depth of the tree, sort files alphabetically, and sort files by size.

For more details, you can review the individual script files within the 'submission' folder.
